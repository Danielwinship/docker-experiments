# my-docker-fullstack-project

<p align="center"><img src="./logo.png" width=530 /></p>

This started as a simple use case to discover `docker`, `docker-compose` üê≥ and the creation of `Dockerfile` in both development and production:

* A [front](front) made with create-react-app, running in a nodejs container for development (only the built artefacts will be used in production, not this container)
* A very simple [api](api) made in go (the challenge is also not to have everything in JavaScript), containerized in docker with a development and a production image

I also setup **deployments on a local kubernetes** ‚ò∏Ô∏è - it can be fun to start to play with if you want to discover kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

You need to have installed:

* docker / docker-compose
* npm / node (optional)
* local kubernetes server and client (only if you want to play with kubernetes deployment - more about that on the [deployment section](#deployment---kubernetes))

## Development

### Install / launch

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

This will create (if not already done) and launch a whole development stack, based on [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml), [docker-compose.override.yml](docker-compose.override.yml), [api/Dockerfile](api/Dockerfile) and [front/Dockerfile](front/Dockerfile) - following images:

* `topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_front_development`: for react development (based on nodejs image)
* `topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_api_development`: for golang in development mode (using [fresh](https://github.com/pilu/fresh) to build and restart the go webserver when you change the sources)
  * The `services.api.command` entry in [docker-compose.override.yml](docker-compose.override.yml) will override the default `RUN` command and start a dev server (instead of running the binary compiled in the container at build time)

Go to http://localhost:3000/ to access the frontend, you're good to go, the api is accessible at http://localhost:5000/.

## Tests

To run all tests:

```shell
docker-compose run --rm -e CI=true front npm run -s test && docker-compose run --rm api go test -run ''
```

‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Make shortcuts for tests from the root of the project (some shortcuts are already available in [front](front#tasks)) / parallelize tests ? Maybe a Makefile ?

## Production - docker-compose

This section is about **testing the production images with docker-compose** üê≥ (check the [deployment section](#deployment---kubernetes) to deploy with kubernetes locally).

Make sure you have built the frontend with `docker-compose run --rm front npm run build`, then:

```shell
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml -f ./docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
```

This will create (if not already done) and launch a whole production stack:

* No nodejs image (it should not be shipped to production, the development image is only used to launch the container that creates the build artefacts with create-react-app).
* `topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_api_production`: for the golang server (with the app compiled) - containing only the binary of the golang app (that way the image)
* `topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_nginx`: which will:
  * serve the frontend (copied from `/front/build`)
  * proxy `/api` requests to `http://api:5000` (the docker subnet exposed by the golang api container)

Access [http://localhost](http://localhost) and you're good to go.

## Deployment - kubernetes

This section is about **deploying the app locally with kubernetes** ‚ò∏Ô∏è (not tested with a cloud provider). To stay simple, there aren't any TLS termination management (only port 80 exposed).

Local kubernetes server and client:

* If you have the latest docker for Mac, both are [shipping with kubernetes](https://blog.docker.com/2018/01/docker-mac-kubernetes/)
* Otherwise, you can use [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) for the server and install [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) (kubernetes client)

The files descripting the deployments are stored in the [deployments](deployments) folder. You will find two files, each containing the deployment and the service.

### Deploy

1) If you haven't built the frontend, run `docker-compose run --rm front npm run build`

2) Build the production images:

```shell
docker build ./api -t topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_api_production:0.1.0
docker build . -f Dockerfile.prod -t topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_nginx:0.1.0
```

Note: They are tagged `0.1.0`, same version number as in the deployments files (want to put an other version number ? Don't forget to update the deployment files). For the moment, I'm not using [Helm](http://helm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generate-and-template/) that let's you do string interpolation on yml files.

3) Create your pods and services

Make sure nothing is up on port `80`, then:

```shell
kubectl create -f ./deployments/api.yml -f ./deployments/front.yml
```

You're good to go, check out [http://localhost](http://localhost)

To stop and delete the pods/services you created:

```shell
kubectl delete -f ./deployments/api.yml -f ./deployments/front.yml
```

They won't stop right away, you can list them and see their status with:

```shell
kubectl get pods,services
```

## Notes

### Docker Multi-stage builds

Thanks to [docker multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/), the golang application is built in a docker golang:alpine image (which contains all the tooling for golang such as compiler/libs ...) and produces a small image with only a binary in an alpine image (small Linux distrib).

The targets for multi-stage build are specified in the `docker*.yml` config files.

The [api/Dockerfile](api/Dockerfile) will create such a production image by default.

You can tell the difference of weight:

```
docker images
topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_api_production      latest  01f1b575fae6  About a minute ago  11.5MB
topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_api_development     latest  fff1ef3ec29e  8 minutes ago       426MB
topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_front_development   latest  4ed3aea602ef  22 hours ago        225MB
```

### Docker networks / Kubernetes services

In development, the api server in golang is available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and proxied onto [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api) (the same port as the front, thanks to create-react-app [proxy](front/README.md#proxy)).

In **production** mode, we only want the golang server to be available via `/api` (we don't want to expose it on it's own port).

To make it work:

* the docker-compose golang api service is named `api` - [see docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).
* the kubernetes services exposing the api is also named `api` - [see deployments/api.yml](deployments/api.yml)

That way, the nginx conf can work with both docker-compose AND kubernetes, proxying `http://api` - [see nginx/site.conf](nginx/site.conf).

### Restart on failure

If your app exits with a failure code (greater than 0) inside the container, you'll want it to restart (like you would do with pm2 and node apps).

With [docker-compose/production](#production---docker-compose), the, directive `restart: on-failure` in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file will ensure that. You'll be able to check it by clicking on the "exit 1 the api server" button, which will exit the golang api. You'll see that the uptime is back counting from 0 seconds.

With [kubernetes/deployment](#deployment---kubernetes), I setup 2 replicas of the api server, so when you retrieve the infos, the hostname might change according of the api pod you're balance on.

Exiting one pod won't break the app, it will fallback on the remaining replica. If you exit the two pods, you'll get an error retrieving infos, until one of the pod is back up by kubernetes (check their status with `kubectl get pods`).

### Commands

#### Docker commands

* `docker-compose run --rm front npm run test`: launch a front container in *development* mode and run tests
* `docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml run --rm api <cmd>`: launch an api container in *production* mode and run `<cmd>`
* `docker-compose down`: stop and remove containers, networks, volumes, and images created by `docker-compose up`

Don't want to use `docker-compose` (everything bellow is already specified in the `docker*.yml` files - only dropping to remember the syntax for the futur) ?

* `docker build ./api -t topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_api_production`: build the `api` and tag it as `topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_api_production` based on [api/Dockerfile](api/Dockerfile)
* `docker run -d -p 5000:5000 topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_api_production`: runs the `topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_api_production` image previously created in daemon mode and exposes the ports
* `docker build ./front -t topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_front_development`: build the `front` and tag it as `topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_front_development` based on [front/Dockerfile](front/Dockerfile)
* `docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/front:/usr/front -v front-deps:/usr/front/node_modules topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_front_development`:
  * runs the `topheman/my-docker-fullstack-project_front_development` image previously created in attach mode
  * exposes the port 3000
  * creates (if not exists) and bind the volumes
  * the container will be removed once you kill the process (`--rm`)

#### Kubernetes commands

[kubectl Cheat Sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/)

* `kubectl create -f ./deployments/api.yml -f ./deployments/front.yml`: creates the resources specified in the declaration files
* `kubectl delete -f ./deployments/api.yml -f ./deployments/front.yml`: deletes resources specified in the declaration files
* `kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment/my-docker-fullstack-project-api-deployment`: scales up the api through 3 pods

## What's next?

The next thing that will be comming are:

* [ ] setup CI
* [x] using [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) as a reverse-proxy to:
  * [x] serve the golang api which is in its own container on `/api`
  * [x] make a build of the front and serve it at the root
* [x] use [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to automate deployment
  * [x] start by playing in local with [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube)
  * [ ] add [Helm](http://helm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generate-and-template/) to do string interpolation in yaml description files ?
* [ ] linting / formatting + pre-commit hooks
  * [ ] add linting / formatting support (eslint/prettier) with advanced config for the JavaScript part
  * [ ] back it up with pre-commit hooks (husky ?)
  * The challenge being:
    * any npm dependency is currently installed on a volume mounted inside the front container (not accessible by host)
    * how to elegantly have lint/formatting task also running on host (for vscode plugins for example but also npm tasks like), without relying on global modules (this would be cheating üòâ + we should not assume anything about the computer our project is cloned on)
    * how to elegantly share pre-commit hooks ? (using husky would mean an `npm install` at the root of the project)

*This is still in progress*.
